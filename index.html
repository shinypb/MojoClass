    <h2>A small implementation of classes and inheritance for JavaScript.</h2>

    <h2>Why?</h2>

    <p>I was working on a project and realized that the whole thing would be infinitely easier with classes and inheritance at my disposal. It seemed like a good time to learn some of the intricacies of implementing such things.</p>

    <h2>Who?</h2>

    <p>My name is Mark, and I think you're neat. I'm <a href="http://twitter.com/shinypb">@shinypb</a> on Twitter.</p>

    <h2>Example</h2>

    <pre>
      // Class declarations
      var Person = mojoClass(function(name) {
        // This is a constructor
        this.name = name;
      }, {
        greet: function(someoneElse) {
          if(someoneElse) {
            return 'Hello, ' + someoneElse + '. My name is ' + this.name + '!';
          } else {
            return 'Hello. My name is ' + this.name + '!';
          }
        }
      });

      var AngryPerson = mojoClass(Person, {
        greet: function(someoneElse) {
          return this._super.greet(someoneElse).toUpperCase();
        }
      });

      // Class usage
      var mark = new Person('Mark');
      console.log('Person:', mark.greet());
      console.log('Person:', mark.greet('Nathalie'));

      var angryMark = new AngryPerson('Mark');
      console.log('AngryPerson:', angryMark.greet());
      console.log('AngryPerson:', angryMark.greet('Nathalie'));
      console.log('AngryPerson instanceof Person?', angryMark instanceof Person);
    </pre>

    <h2>More details</h2>

    <p>To create a new class, call the mojoClass function. You can pass in a variety of things:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>The parent class to inherit from (optional)</li>
    <li>A constructor (optional)</li>
    <li>An object containing all of the methods and properties of the instance</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Subclasses can access the methods of their parent class by calling this.super.methodName();</p>

    <h2>Thanks</h2>

    <p>Thanks for Mozilla for providing <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind">an implementation of bind</a> for browsers that don't support it, and John Resig for his <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/">Simple JavaScript Inheritance</a> post, which reminded me of the instanceof operator.</p>

    <h2>Randomly...</h2>

    <p>I didn't set out to write a particularly small implementation when I started, but out of curiosity, I poked around a bit to see how mojo compared. If you're looking for something positively tiny, John Resig's Simple JavaScript Inheritance is only 25 lines of code. Eep!</p>
